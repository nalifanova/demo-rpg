# Design of Demo RPG

## Ideas

Some quick theoretical lists that we will iterate on.

### Character classes

- Warrior: highest hp/damage reduction
- Wizard: uses magic
- Cleric: uses support magic
- Rogue: highest consistent melee/ranged damage

#### Stats
- Hit Points: (which is PointsStack here)
- Strength: involved in Physical Calculations
- Intelligence: involved in Magic Calculations 
- Agility: involved in Nimbleness Calculations
- Armor: Involved in Physical Reduction Calculations
- Resistance: Involved in Element Damage Reduction Calculations

### Leveling System
Gain stats and abilities based on class and levels

### Levels
- Level Trees

### Items
- shop system
- equipment
- consumables

### Game Loop
- battle system: turn based
- world levels
- different monsters
