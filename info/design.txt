# demo RPG

coding some basic RPG systems in C++

## designs in mind

some quick theoretical lists to get started

### character classes

- warrior: highest hp/damage reduction
- wizard: uses magic
- cleric: uses support magic
- rogue: highest consistent melee/ranged damage

#### Stats
- hit points
- strength - hp level
- intellect - mana level
- agility (?) - stamina level

### leveling system
- gain stats based on class
- gain abilities based on level

### equipment
- shop system
- equipment
- consumables

### game loop
- battle system: turn based
- world levels
- different monsters


### Level Up System

// Notes: thinking process & understanding process :P
// 1 = 0xp needed
// 2 = level_2_at exp needed
// 3 = level_2_at * 2 exp needed
// 4 = level_2_at * 2 * 2 exp needed
